# Hot [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gernest/hot.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/gernest/hot)

Hot is a library for rendering hot golang templates. This means with `hot` you won't need to recompile your application everytime you edit your templates.Hot watches for file changes in your templates directory and reloads everytime you make changes to your files.

hot renders go templates usin `html/template` package.

# Installation

	go get github.com/gernest/hot

# Usage

Just pass the configuration object to `hot.New`

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"

	"github.com/gernest/hot"
)

func main() {
	config := &hot.Config{
		Watch:          true,
		BaseName:       "hot",
		Dir:            "fixtures",
		FilesExtension: []string{".tpl", ".html", ".tmpl"},
	}
	
	tpl,err:=hot.New(&config)
	if err!+nil{
		panic(err)
	}
	
	// execute the template named "hello.tpl
    tpl.Execute(os.Stdout,"hello.tpl",nil)	
}
```

Note that the fixtures directory should exist and there is a template file `hello.tpl` in it , `hot` will be watching any changes to the files inside this directory.
